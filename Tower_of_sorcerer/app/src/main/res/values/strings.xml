    <string name="game_finish_message">You successfully beat the game!</string>
    <string name="saint_2f">Thank you so much for saving me. I can increase your attack and defense power
        by 3 percent. Do you want me to do it now?</string>
    <string name="saint_3f">Alas, my age is catching up to me. I can fight no more. Brave young man,
        you should take this Staff of Wisdom since I have no use for it. It will reveal the strength of
        monsters so you could better prepare your fight against them. Take care and good luck.</string>
    <string name="saint_4f">There are doors which cannot be opened with a key. To open them, you will have
        to defeat the monsters which guard them.</string>
    <string name="saint_6f">After you make a purchase from a merchant, go talk to him again because he
        will tell you some important information.</string>
    <string name="saint_16f">I heard that there are two hidden red keys hidden in this area.</string>
    <string name="saint_16fh">Thank god, you saved me! I was stuck in the tunnel because the slime-man
        blocked the exit. Take this bottle of Elixir as a symbol of my gratitude. It recovers your health
        based on your attack and defense power. The stronger you are, the more health you will recover.</string>
    <string name="saint_18f">Many knights had failed to pass this area because of those Rock Monsters.
        Their defenses are just too high. Maybe you should increase your offense at the
        altar a few time in this area.</string>
    <string name="saint_21f">Do you know the Archmage in this area is the owner of this tower? He is way
        too strong for you now. Fighting him is suicide. You should go to higher floors
        and get stronger first.</string>
    <string name="saint_23f0">It is said that there is a hidden message in this floor.</string>
    <string name="saint_23f1">Go 0F!</string>
    <string name="saint_27f">At this current stage, if you have 1500 health, 80 attack, 98 defense, 5
        yellow keys and 1 blue key, you are almost ideal.</string>
    <string name="saint_31f">The attack power of the swordsmen is too high. You should only fight them when
        you can one shot them, or you will lose a lot of health.</string>
    <string name="saint_33f">More haste, less speed.</string>
    <string name="saint_36f">If you find the four secret tunnels in this floor, you will be able to go
        upstairs without fighting strong enemies.</string>
    <string name="saint_37f">This floor is an item warehouse, but to get the treasure, you will have to use
        the mattock.</string>
    <string name="saint_39f">At three o\'clock, the secret treasure which allows you to teleport three time
        will appear.</string>
    <string name="saint_42f">Mages can attack from a distance with their magic. A pair of Demon Sergeants
        can form an invisible demon gate which cut your health in half when you pass by.</string>
    <string name="saint_45f">The 44th floor is in a different dimension, and you can\'t get there with
        stairs. But you may try to teleport.</string>
    <string name="saint_46f">There is a secret about the 41st floor - it is perfectly symmetrical even
        though it doesn't seem to be.</string>
    <string name="saint_48f">The shape of five on a dice is actually an ancient symbol for sealing magic.
        Remember the symbol because it will help you in the future.</string>
    <string name="saint_default">Good luck young man!</string>
    <string name="merchant_2f0">Thank you so much for freeing me. Please take this 1000 gold as a gift.</string>
    <string name="merchant_6f0">I have a blue key for 50 gold. Would you like to buy it?</string>
    <string name="merchant_7f0">I have 5 yellow keys for 50 gold. Would you like to buy them?</string>
    <string name="merchant_12f0">I have a red key for 800 gold. Would you like to buy it?</string>
    <string name="merchant_12fh">I have lots of yellow keys, 1000 gold each. Would you like to buy one?</string>

    <string name="merchant_28f">Would you like to sell your yellow keys to me for 100 gold each.
        I need lots of them.</string>

        to buy them?</string>
    <string name="merchant_38f0">I have 3 yellow keys for 200 gold. Would you like to buy them?</string>
    <string name="merchant_39f0">I have 3 blue keys for 2000 gold. Would you like to buy them?</string>
    <string name="merchant_45f0">I can recover you 2000 health for 1000 gold. Would you let me do it?</string>
    <string name="merchant_47f0">I have a enhanced mattock for 4000 gold. Would you like to buy it?</string>
    <string name="merchant_2f1">Thank you. Good luck on your journey</string>
    <string name="merchant_6f1">This tower consists of 50 floors. Every 10 floors form one area, and each area
        has one boss guarding the entrance to the next area. To proceed, you must defeat
        these bosses.</string>
    <string name="merchant_7f1">When you offer gold in exchange for strength at an alter, you should put your
        priority on defense. However, you cannot completely ignore offense either.</string>
    <string name="merchant_12f1">Have you found the secret tunnels on the 9th, 16th, and 18th floor? I heard
        that there are more of them on higher floors.</string>
    <string name="merchant_15f1">When you carry a cross, your attacks will be twice as effective against
        zombies and the Vampire, and I don\'t think you can defeat the Vampire without it. There is a cross
        hidden on a floor higher than this one.</string>
    <string name="merchant_31f1">Even though the tower is said to have 50 floors, I have never heard anyone
        reaching to the 50th floor.</string>
    <string name="merchant_38f1">There is never a gate without Gate-Keepers, and there is always a gate when
        you see Gate-Keepers.</string>
    <string name="merchant_39f1">There is a Lucky Gold hidden in this tower. If you carry it with you, you will
        get twice as much money from battles.</string>
    <string name="merchant_45f1">I heard that the Sacred Shield can protect you against all kinds of magic
        powers. But I also heard that this shield is hidden on a floor which doesn't
        exist.</string>
    <string name="merchant_47f1">I heard that to kill the Dragon, you must have a holy sword, a holy
        shield, and most importantly the Dragonsbane, which doubles your attack against the Dragon.</string>
    <string name="merchant_default">Keep it secret, and don\'t tell others</string>
    <string name="purchase_fail">You don\'t have enough gold.</string>

    <string name="thief0">Who am I? I am a thief, and I\'m looking for a treasure in this tower. Even though I
        was caught, it\'s not a big deal you know? \'cause I just need to spend a few nights digging tunnels
        and I will be out of here. And you are such a lucky dog, bro. \'cause I have just finished the tunnel
        planning to get out, and you were thrown in my cell. Follow me and let\'s get out!</string>
    <string name="thief1">Forgot to tell you, but you should have figured out by now that your weapons were
        taken away. It\'s not wise to fight monsters without any weapons. I know there is one old iron sword
        on the 5th floor, and one old iron shield on the 9th floor. I ain\'t gonna call them good weapons but
        still, better than nothing, right? By the way, I have dug many tunnels in this tower. I covered them
        to look just like regular walls, but if you are able to find them, they will help you a lot. Good
        luck bro. See ya.</string>
    <string name="thief2">Oh wow! You are much stronger than I thought, bro. You killed the Skeleton Captain
        and his soldiers all by yourself? Damn, that\'s amazing. You know thers is a silver sword on 17th
        floor, right? Good luck finding it. I got to go. See ya.</string>
    <string name="thief3">Wow, look at who is here! The Skeleton Captain Slayer! Did the giant octopus block
        your way? It\'s such a pain in the ass! I counld\'t get around it so I had to dig this tunnel. You
        came just in time. Enjoy this free tunnel. See you later!</string>
    <string name="thief4">Yo, bro. Nice to see ya. Sigh, I am out of luck. Can\'t find my treasure anywhere.
        I\'m taking some rest.</string>
    <string name="thief5">Thank you so much for saving me bro! Thought I was doomed. I got caught again, but
        this time they saw my mattock and took it away, so I can\'t dig tunnels to get out. But you came and
        saved me. I can\'t thank you enough. Is the Dragon on the 35th floor blocking your way? Don\'t you
        worry bro. I got your back. I have hidden my other mattocks in the tower. Let me find one frist and
        I will dig a tunnel for you so you can get around the Dragon.</string>
    <string name="thief6_1">Give me some time to find my hidden mattocks, bro. I will catch you up on the
        35th floor.</string>
    <string name="thief6_2">Just follow the tunnel I have dug for you, and you will be on your way upstairs.
        After this incident, I realized that it\'s not worth risking my life looking for some treasures which
        may not even exist. I\'m outta here. Good luck saving the princess. Goodbye.</string>
    <string name="thief7">What? Thief!? Why are you here? Didn\'t you leave?</string>
    <string name="thief8">Haha! Pretty surprised seeing me huh? The only reason I am here is that I am Zeno!</string>
    <string name="thief9">But why? Why would you help when you could easily kill me?</string>
    <string name="thief10">Because of power. I want more power!!! The Archmage is only slightly stronger than
        me, but he became the owner of this tower while I was assigned to be the region boss on the 50th floor.
        When I found him became obsessed with his spell book, I knew my chance was coming. Before he locked himself
        up in his chamber trying to create the strongest spell, I managed to replace the last page of his book so he
        would never succeed. Later, I started to kill his minions and he did know because he has not gone out of his
        chamber yet. Now he is dead and I will rule this tower!</string>
    <string name="thief11">If I can kill him, what makes you think I won\'t kill you?</string>
    <string name="thief12">Because of the sacred weapons you are wielding now. According to the last page of the
        spell book. Both the Sacred Sword and the Sacred Shield were born in the lava. They were purified by the
        holy fire so they resist magic. I first tried to get these weapons myself but I almost died to the lava
        protecting the Sacred Shield. I realized I should better let others to do the job, and that\'s why the
        legend goes that there is a princess in this tower. The foolish Archmage must have used magic against you,
        but when he realized it was not working, it was too late, since you already killed him. Knowing this, I
        trained myself battling without using magic. Once I kill you and take your weapons, I would be invincible!
        Now is the time. Let the fight begin!</string>
